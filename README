A compiler for the "mini" toy language

Targets:
* amd64 on OS X (MachO binaries)
* amd64 on GNU/Linux (ELF binaries)

Requirements:
* make
* ANTLR requires jdk 1.5 or greater
* jars for the following must be in the CLASSPATH for the parser to build
   - ANTLR 3.5.2 or greater
   - javax-json 1.0.4 or greater
* mlton 20130715 or greater
* as and ld must be in the PATH

To build mc:
1. Clone this repo and all sub-modules.
2. `cd` into the "mini-parser" directory and run `make`.
3. In the parent directory run `make`.

To run the benchmarks use the "runTests.sh" script. The script takes a single argument, the number of times to run each test to obtain time averages. The default is 10.
